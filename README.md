# Wet_market_scan
Each day, the Collector visits stalls using the app. They open the scanner, scan the stallâ€™s QR code, and the system finds the stall in the database. Payment is marked as paid for the day, with the amount filled in automatically. The Collector can adjust the amount if needed and add notes for reference.
